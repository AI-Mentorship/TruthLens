## How It Works

### Analysis Algorithm

The extension uses a scoring system to evaluate products:

**Scam Indicators (increase scam score):**
- Suspicious keywords (scam, fake, replica, counterfeit)
- Suspicious patterns (excessive caps, exclamation marks)
- Unrealistically low prices
- Short or overly long product titles
- Suspicious seller names

**Legitimacy Indicators (increase legit score):**
- Trusted sellers (Amazon, Walmart)
- Reasonable price ranges
- Well-structured product titles
- Established seller profiles

**Final Decision:**
- **Scam** (Red X): Score ‚â• 3
- **Uncertain** (Yellow dots): Score ‚â• 2 or legit score < 1
- **Legitimate** (Green tick): All other cases

### Technical Implementation

- **Content Script**: Injects indicators into product listings
- **Popup Interface**: React-based UI for statistics and controls
- **Storage**: Tracks daily analysis statistics
- **Communication**: Real-time updates between content script and popup

## Usage

1. **Install the extension** following the installation steps above
2. **Browse supported e-commerce sites** - indicators will appear automatically
3. **Click the extension icon** to view statistics and controls
4. **Toggle analysis** on/off as needed
5. **Check the legend** in the popup to understand the indicators
